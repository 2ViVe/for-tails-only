						<h1>Nuestra Misión</h1>



						<h2>To change the world through better health, wealth and relationships.</h2>



						<p>Through the Alpha Body Challenge, we have been able to pull together people from all walks of life to focus on the mission at hand. The philosophy is very simple. Put the people first, as they are the champions of our philosophy. The biggest asset to any successful company always has been and always will be its people. So, rather than looking at you as dispensable as would any other company, we appreciate you. We take the time to inspire, motivate, and walk you through the steps to your success. Our goal is to allow you to achieve what makes you happy!</p>



					</div>



					<div class="fright" id="homevision">



						<h1>Our Vision</h1>



						<h2>To build a family so massive it will empower people across the known world.</h2>



						<p>We are much more than a company delivering high quality nutrition products. We are a people driven company with a clear mission to improve the global community we live in. ZVI is committed to helping individuals, not only with the incredible benefits of its products, but with a business opportunity that opens the door to personal success and potentially limitless financial success. By providing a system that allows the average person across the world to develop financial intelligence, freedom to capitalize and achieve goals ZoiVi will influence the state of economy, one person at a time.</p>

					<h1>A Message from the Founder </h1>



					<div class="fleft"><img src="../../custom/DefaultTheme/abc_es/images/ahmadevaji.jpg" class="/custom/DefaultTheme/abc_es/imageshadow profileimage" alt=""></div>



					<p>The philosophy behind ZVI is the fuel to our success. It is very simple: design a vehicle that allows anyone seeking success and stability to be able to achieve it. In today's &quot;modernized&quot; yet failing economy, many people are forced to seek other avenues to make ends meet. As companies are cutting back and playing it safe, people are being forced to find other jobs, or take on side jobs, while they continue to struggle in the rat race.</p>



					<p>Others finally wake up to the realization that as long as their livelihood is dependent on anyone other than themselves, they will always fall short of their goals. People today are simply just sick and tired of being sick and tired, and want to do more than be, &quot;Just Over Broke&quot;. In today's slow moving economy and fast paced environment, opportunity to people becomes the same as finding water in a desert. It is possible; however, most people would think it is a mirage, or something too good to be true. The problem is worse when an opportunity comes along their way, and the people in their surroundings do not know enough about it offer an intelligent opinion. Add in a decaying economy, and it is no wonder why people experience struggle.</p>



					<p>Any successful person will tell you to take risks, watch for trends in timing, supply demands and never give up. Today's biggest lack in the economy is the ability to earn a solid income. Here in ZVI, we have the supply. This is the easiest time to be able to ride a surge in what is predicted to be the &quot;largest shift of wealth&quot; in the history of man. From Trump and Warren Buffet to Citigroup and Nestle, the success icons in today's society are no longer the only ones with the secret. Now, of all times, it would be easiest to see that shift. I believe more people now than ever are finally tired of being blind to opportunity and are ready to do something about it. Who knew that with an economic meltdown would come so much opportunity?</p>



					<p>No one ever thought the same industries that gave rise to America and its &quot;Land of Opportunity&quot; reputation would be the same ones to be the cause of our economic collapse. As a result, social marketing companies today are surging, and creating more success stories than ever before. As the college degree and corporate career paths are no longer good enough, more and more traditional business people, corporate staff members who had suffered layoffs and &quot;Mass Firings&quot; are turning to networking as a way to achieve, match and surpass their lost incomes, without the high cost and years of education.</p>



					<p>If building a strong financial future and leading a fulfilling lifestyle is something you have been looking for, ZVI will give you the chance to experience exactly that. Not only will you make many friends who share those same exact goals, you will also experience the fun of being in business for yourself, but not by yourself. The timing of the economy, the exponential growth, as we pioneer the industry will change the way America earns, learns, and lives forever. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity; a chance for anyone who wants to experience success to be able to do so.</p>



					<p>When I immigrated to this country with my family, I was about 7 years old. I remember the tense and nervous excitement of coming to America; the idea of abundance and wealth were new to me, since I came from a humble upbringing. My father was a carpet installer, and my mother was raising 4 children while working just to make ends meet. I remember them working long 16 hour days, and coming home too tired to do anything but sleep.</p>



					<p>Remembering those days are what inspired me to design a system as simple as ZVI. I understand the frustration of trying to provide for a family, and at the end of the day not having enough or when there is too much month left at the end of the money. I know what it's like to have to juggle bills, debating which were more important to pay and which could wait. I used to think like everyone else, I thought if only there were more hours in a day! This is what led me to create ZVI. I had gone through enough experiences working in corporate America to know that it was almost impossible there. I saw many of my friends struggle to pay off loans and debts incurred from college, simply because they couldn't find a job in their field. I had an answer for them.</p>



					<p>Today we have an opportunity of a lifetime. The challenges I went through growing up, the experience of working in corporate America, allowed me to understand what people are looking for. Here in ZVI, people find it. It is simply the greatest financial vehicle for the average person across the known world. It is also the fastest way to go from struggle to success, provided one is willing to put in the sweat equity and work required to do so. A colleague once told me you can &quot;walk, run, or fly to success.&quot; In ZVI, anyone can FLY. Combined with the experience and support staff of entrepreneurs from around the world, it becomes a school of learning while earning. We have a superior compensation plan, a proven business model, proven leadership, and an effective training system.</p>



					<p>We don't try to be different, we simply are. The difference between our company and every other one out there is that here, it can be different for you too. From the distributors, to corporate staff, we take the extra step to make sure anyone that is a part of this family has the same opportunity as any successful person in life, regardless of where they are from, or what they know. As we grow our team to the million member mark, I look forward to welcoming you to the family. As we grow, so do you, because the company's success is tied into your success. With that, good luck, and I will see you at the next big event!</p>

					<h1>5 Elements to Momentum</h1>



					<div id="momentumsocial">



						<h2>With social marketing being such a vast industry, it's normal to have heard of, been approached by, or even attempted to become a part of one of the many companies out there.</h2>



						<p>In the process, a few companies have the elements needed for success, while others are usually lacking in one area or another. So, with all of these options, how do you know which opportunity is the right one for you? And, once decided on, would it be simple to share the idea with others who have already been exposed to the industry and get them excited about it?</p>



						<p>There is only one company that will stand above all, setting the standard and changing the face of the industry; ZoiVi. There were none before us, there will be none after us, that makes us the one and only - Discover the 5 elements that will allow to participate in one of the largest shifts of wealth in the history of any industry!</p>



						<h2>Since January 1, 2011 ZoiVi International has grown beyond everyone's expectation.</h2>



						<p>In fact, ZoiVi International is one of the fastest growing companies in the industry. As the health and wellness industry continues to grow around the world, and grand opportunities become rare there are critical elements that will separate the truly great companies from the "me too" companies around.</p>



						<p><h2>Making an informed decision and take action now!</h2></p>



					</div>



					<div class="highlighted" id="elements">



						<div>						



							<h2><span>ELEMENT 1</span> - The Product</h2>



							<p class="acenter"><img src="../../custom/DefaultTheme/abc_es/images/elem-product.png" alt=""></p>



							<h3>Are the products high quality, category creating and highly consumable?</h3>



							<p>ZoiVi offers an exclusive line of unique, natural, instantly gratifying, highly emotional, health and wellness products. Our products are 100% consumable, lifestyle oriented and available around the world. You make the choice to either be an exclusive product user, an independent business partner...or both. It's up to you!</p>



						</div>



						<div>						



							<h2><span>ELEMENT 2</span> - The System</h2>



							<p class="acenter"><img src="../../custom/DefaultTheme/abc_es/images/elem-system.png" alt=""></p>



							<h3>Does this company offer an effective and proven system to guide me as I work towards success?</h3>



							<p>ZoiVi offers a unique training system that has created success stories around the world! A hand in hand system focused on developing leaders, simple to follow and ensures the success of everyone in the organization. This guarantees a strong support system.</p>



						</div>



						<div>						



							<h2><span>ELEMENT 3</span> - Compensation</h2>



							<p class="acenter"><img src="../../custom/DefaultTheme/abc_es/images/elem-compensation.png" alt=""></p>



							<h3>Does the plan really work?</h3>



							<p>ZoiVi has created an aggressive, easy to understand compensation plan that allows ten different income streams. ZoiVi's compensation program was designed by distributors for distributors, and allows you to maximize results part time, time, all the time.</p>



						</div>



						<div>						



							<h2><span>ELEMENT 4</span> - Timing</h2>



							<p class="acenter"><img src="../../custom/DefaultTheme/abc_es/images/elem-timing.png" alt=""></p>



							<h3>Are you aligned to ride the surge?</h3>



							<p>Since 01/01/11, ZoiVi has been strategically setup for a seamless global expansion. With products being the first of its kind on the market, the ground-floor positioning of ZoiVi will allow you to leverage the ability to be the first to market, everywhere! There are no territories, no limits, and zero competition.</p>



						</div>



						<div>						



							<h2><span>ELEMENT 5</span> - Leadership</h2>



							<p class="acenter"><img src="../../custom/DefaultTheme/abc_es/images/elem-leader.png" alt=""></p>



							<h3>Are the leaders of ZoiVi leading from the front while share opportunity, wealth, and information?</h3>



							<p>All great companies are the result of the leadership they attract and the team that supports them. ZoiVi's founder began as a distributor, and built it from the ground floor up. In ZoiVi, it is a system truly built on the experience of its independent partners. The owner and leaders of ZoiVi are ethical and hard working with a passion for creating a family, not a corporate culture. Successful relationships coupled with integrity become a powerful piece of the life puzzle as you build your business, and with ZoiVi it is the very foundation that your business is built on.</p>
