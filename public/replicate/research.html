						<p>Ancient health-care traditions combined with modern scientific   research, fertile soil, correct growing conditions, and ISO- and   FDA-inspected extraction facilities of the raw material ingredients,   technical expertise and strict adherence to Quality Control and FDA   regulatory and cGMP procedures make ZVI's products among the very   finest in the industry.</p>

						<h1 id="processhead">ZVI's Manufacturing Process</h1>

						<p> What makes the ZVI product line so powerful and unique is how it   is designed. Every ingredient in our blends is the purest form available   from around the world. In fact, from seed to bottle we know exactly   where it is grown, tested, extracted, tested again, blended, tested   again and bottled. Even the bottles and lids are QC tested for   contaminants!</p>

						<p> The facilities are FDA regulated, the manufacturing process is cGMP, with strict Quality Control and Quality Assurance testing</p>

						<p class="qctest"> The three main Quality Control tests are for <span>Identity</span>, <span>Microbial</span>, and <span>Efficacy</span></p>

							<div class="fleft" id="idtesting">

								<div class="acenter"><img src="./custom/DefaultTheme/images/testing-id-icon.png" alt=""></div>

								<h2>1. Identity Testing</h2>

								<p> First, every single ingredient is identity-tested. This takes one day. The tests are done using HPLC, TLC and ISP:</p>

								<ul class="origin">

									<li> <b>HPLC:</b> High-performance liquid chromatography (sometimes referred to   as high-pressure liquid chromatography). HPLC is a chromatographic   technique that can separate a mixture of compounds and is used in   biochemistry and analytical chemistry to identify, quantify and purify   the individual components of the mixture. [Chromatography: separation of   mixtures using laboratory techniques]</li>

									<li> <b>TLC:</b> Thin layer chromatography is a chromatography technique used to separate mixtures. Thin layer chromatography is performed on a sheet of glass,   plastic, or aluminum foil, which is coated with a thin layer of   adsorbent material, usually silica gel, aluminum oxide, or cellulose   (blotter paper).</li>

									<li> This layer of adsorbent is known as the stationary phase.   [Adsorption is the adhesion of atoms, ions, biomolecules or molecules of   gas, liquid, or dissolved solids to a surface.] </li>

									<li> After the sample has been applied on the plate, a solvent or   solvent mixture (known as the mobile phase) is drawn up the plate via   capillary action. </li>

									<li> Because different analytes ascend the TLC plate at different rates, separation is achieved. </li>

									<li> <b>ISP:</b> Induction Plasma testing for the detection of trace metals, such as zinc. </li>

									<li> This analytical technique produces excited atoms and ions that emit   electromagnetic radiation at wavelengths characteristic of a particular   element.</li>

								</ul>

							</div>

							<div class="fleft" id="mbtesting">

								<div class="acenter"><img src="./custom/DefaultTheme/images/testing-micro-icon.png" alt=""></div>

								<h2>2. Microbial Testing</h2>

								<p>Second, Microbial testing is done to look for 6 main pathogens (germs or microbes): </p>

								<ul class="origin">

									<li> <b>E. Coli</b></li>

									<li> <b>Salmonella</b></li>

									<li> <b>Pseudomonas</b> (a common bacteria found in humans and animals that can cause infection). </li>

									<li> <b>Staphylococcus</b> is a genus of Gram-positive bacteria. [Under the   microscope, they appear round (cocci), and form in grape-like clusters.] </li>

									<li> <b>Coliform bacteria:</b> found in water and vegetation, indication of bacteria and viruses, when present. </li>

									<li> <b>Entero bacteria</b>, usually residing in the guts of many animals. [A   clean environment and plenty of hand washing usually eliminates it. </li>

									<li> All workers in the production area have to wash and sanitize their   hands for at least 15 to 20 seconds before going into the production   area, after eating, going to the bathroom and smoking.</li>

									<li> The Microbial testing is two to five days using petri dishes (shallow dishes).</li>

									<li> We even test the bottles and lids with a swab before we put them on the filling lines</li>

									<li> Then we do QC testing on the finished product after they have been   bottled and labeled, in case there was any contamination on the lines.   This takes 5 working days.</li>

								</ul>

							</div>

							<div class="fleft" id="eftesting">

								<div class="acenter"><img src="./custom/DefaultTheme/images/testing-lab-icon.png" alt=""></div>

								<h2>3. Efficacy Testing</h2>

								<p> Thirdly, we test for Efficacy: We have specifications of each   ingredient that state the strength of the particular compound, such as   10% forskohlin in the Coleus forskohlii in the Burn.</p>

								<ul class="origin">

									<li> We use HPLC testing using gas chromatography to test for these compounds.<br />

								<ul class="origin">

									<li> ZVI's products are not mass-manufactured and stored in warehouses for months or years waiting for purchases. </li>

									<li> Although it is a more expensive manufacturing process, the customer   gets a product we know is guaranteed for freshness, safety, efficacy   and results.</li>

									<p> Hesperidin, a citrus bioflavonoid, inhibits bone loss and decreases   serum and hepatic lipids in ovariectomized mice. J Nutr. 2003.</p>

									<p> The purpose of this study was to examine whether hesperidin inhibits   bone loss in ovariectomized mice (OVX), an animal model of   postmenopausal osteoporosis. Hesperidin administration did not affect   the uterine weight. These results suggest a possible role for citrus   bioflavonoids in the prevention of lifestyle-related diseases because of   their beneficial effects on bone and lipids.</p>
