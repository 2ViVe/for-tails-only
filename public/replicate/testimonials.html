								<h4>50 pounds and 4 dress sizes down!</h4>



								<p>If you had met me a couple of years ago you would not think it's the same me now. When I was younger I was very fit, I loved to play sports, and was very active. Eventually, I had less time to commit to these activities since I had to work and take care of my family. That's where my health started to decline...</p>

								<h4>Turning 30, feeling 21!</h4>



								<p>At some point in life everyone starts to take notice of their health, and their way of living. Throughout the years of having a son, working, and going through a divorce health became the last thing I was focused on. I was not aware of how I had let myself go until I woke up one day, looked in the mirror and realized I wasn't...</p>

								<h4>I couldn't believe it</h4>



								<p>I was never quite able to build and sustain the muscle I was looking for. I avoid using things like protein shakes and any of those vitamin store products many people use today. When I was introduced to ZoiVi I was a bit skeptical at how the products would work for me. When I found out the products were pure and all natural I was willing to give it a shot. I was unsure whether to use the detox because a skinny guy like me would seem to have no toxins or wastes in their system. To my surprise...</p>

								<h4>The first time anything worked!</h4>



								<p>It seemed like no matter what I could not stop gaining weight. I had tried everything I could, from eating less, to working out, to the several diet programs out there and none worked for me. One product actually ended up being bad for my heart, giving my chest pains. I had almost given up until my son introduced me to his ZoiVi products...</p>

								<h4>I can finally eat like a normal person</h4>



								<p>I had one major problem with the products; the products were all natural, meaning they were made from various plants, fruits, roots, etc. I'm allergic to nearly all fruits, soybeans, nuts, tree nuts, shellfish, pollen, hair chemicals, dust, dairy, wheat, corn, sesame seeds, walnuts, scallop, water, sun,and MORE. For most of my life my diet has been very restricted...</p>

								<h4>Hello clear skin</h4>



								<p>I was living my worst nightmare. Breakouts are normal for any teenager, but my breakouts looked as if I had some sort of explosion on my face. It was definitely not normal. I was very self conscious and very aware of my skin issue because everywhere I would go I'd be reminded of it...</p>

								<h4>From 264 to 227 and counting</h4>



								<p>My pants size had also shrunk from a size 42 to a 36 waist size. I had always thought this was a dream but now I know this is real. I look at myself in the mirror and I can say I look great almost ideal sexy. Now I need to go buy some new clothes to fit my new self. I never thought I could wear a size Large again when I normally use to wear either XL or XXL T-shirts...</p>

								<h4>6 pounds in 48 hours!</h4>



								<p>Being on the road meant a lot of fast food and junk food, anything easy to eat on the go. Also, being very busy with work, I didn't have the opportunity to work out like I once had. After seeing my struggle to lose weight for about a year, my best friend told me about the ZoiVi products, and how well they had worked for her and her family. Being a skeptic, I wasn't completely sold..</p>

								<h4>I was always easily fatiqued...</h4>



								<p>I was never really aware of my eating habits. Once I started eating I would never know when to stop. I would eat and still be hungry after finishing a whole meal. Bad eating habits along with being very inactive started to really show on my body. I was always tired, and so I didn't exercise much. I started to notice my body changing, but I didn't feel like there was much I could do. I didn't know why I always felt hungry...</p>

								<p>Be a parent, working long hours, and the stresses of daily responsibilities can really make someone lose track of their health.

								<p>I started to gain weight when I began eating out at restaurants all the time. Having a late schedule, I would get hungry at night and have a &quot;midnight snack&quot;, I started to notice my cheeks and my stomach were getting bigger. I think it was more that I didn't want to admit that I was gaining weight than anything else. It was almost like a snowball effect, and my health was going downhill fast...</p>

								<p>I always heard about the freshman 15 people experience when they go off to college. After my first year, I thought I had gotten lucky, since I stayed the same weight and size. My sophomore year is where the problem began, my freshmen 15 didn't hit me until my 2nd year in college. I gained so much weight that I looked like a ball. My face was round, my stomach had never been so big before. I didn't know what to do, I felt disgusting and heavy...</p>

								<p>I had given up with the constant battle. I became used to looking in the mirror at a face with scars and bumps covered with makeup. At that point, not even makeup could cover it. Instead of trying harder to find a solution, I would look for heavier makeup. I was very shy around people, I hated taking pictures, I was frustrated and I just wanted to hide it somehow...</p>

I watched what I ate, counted carbs, counted calories, changed my workouts but no matter how many sit-ups or cardio workouts I did I just couldn't get rid of it.

					<h1>History in the Making</h1>



					<div id="historycontent">



						<p>Since the beginning of time, humanity has searched for optimal health, balance and prosperity. The need for constant evolution has allowed us to live in a world filled with many conveniences and comforts, but at what cost?</p>



						<p>Some would say to live a healthy life, all one would need to do is eat well, sleep well, exercise regularly, and avoid stress. As simple as it sounds, few have been able to find the balance between health and making a living. Obesity rates are rising, diseases are affecting younger and younger generations, and a fast paced hectic way of living forces us to sacrifice something as simple as regular exercise. The polluted air we breathe, processed foods we eat, chemically treated liquids we drink throw the body completely out of balance, putting people at the highest risk for health problems in history!</p>



						<p>No longer can anyone afford to say "I'm all natural." The truth is simple: if you are living, breathing, and eating in this world, you have been exposed to elements that are damaging to the body. This is where ZoiVi can play an important role in the well being of every individual. The direct translation of ZoiVi [Zoy-Vee] is life energy. Energy is the key to being healthy and living a quality life. The only way the body can optimally produce energy is through balance. Having a toxic free, clean system is one part. The nourishment and what one uses to fuel the body is the other. The time to freely lead an active lifestyle ultimately gives completion. ZoiVi has put together an opportunity to achieve exactly that. ZoiVi products are designed to bring the body back into balance, increasing the life energy for maximum livability. In ZoiVi, one can achieve health, wealth, and freedom. Transforming lives around the globe through premium life products, strong leadership, and a commitment to excellence allows everyone find what they have been looking for. We will change and empower the world, re-writing history as we know it.</p>

					<h1>A Company Championed By You</h1>



					<div id="zvdiffcontent">



						<div class="fleft"><img src="./custom/DefaultTheme/images/imh-quote.jpg" alt="" class="/custom/DefaultTheme/imageshadow profileimage"></div>



						<p>There are many opportunities that come and go in life. Very often we hear about the "next biggest thing." So what makes ZoiVi so different? Aside from the unique leadership style, training system, compensation structure, business model and product manufacturing, the number one reason ZoiVi is different from any other company is the emphasis on people. You can have the greatest product in the world, but without great people behind it the product has very little effect.</p>



						<p>In ZoiVi, we have been able to pull together people from all walks of life to focus on the mission at hand. The ZoiVi philosophy is very simple. Put the people first, as they are the champions of our philosophy. The biggest asset to any successful company always has been and always will be its people. So, rather than looking at you as dispensable as would any other company, we appreciate you. We take the time to inspire, motivate, and walk you through the steps to your success. Our goal is to allow you to achieve what makes you happy!</p>



						<p>The magic formula for this breakthrough philosophy originates from the very definition of success. People are happy when they get what they want. While there are many wants and desires, there are three basic needs to be met to experience happiness: health, wealth, and great relationships. When the people are healthy, when the people are wealthy, when the people are able to spend time with loved ones, they are considered successful. These results will cause widespread excitement, and the first thing people want to know when they talk to you and hear about the happenings in your life is: What is ZoiVi? The quick answer would be: "It's just different".</p>

					<h1>Power of Balance</h1>



					<div class="fleft"><img src="./custom/DefaultTheme/images/power-of-balance.jpg" alt="" class="/custom/DefaultTheme/imageshadow profileimage"></div>



					<p>Understanding the balance of health is simple: too much of anything can be a negative, too little of anything can also be a negative. Every day we expose our bodies to many things: substances, lifestyles, and experiences. These are things that have an impact on the mind, body, and even soul. While some effects can be positive, the majority of the time the results are negative. Being overworked and undernourished leads to fatigue, causing the body to overwork itself in order to continue functions. These types of situations can cause an imbalance in the system, many dysfunctions in the body, even fatalities.</p>



					<p>When we are in our prime, the effects are not so obvious. However as time goes on, we begin to : our energy levels change, our moods change, and we begin to feel different. One of the most easily recognizable changes is between the ages of 12-18 years. Children try to avoid sleeping early at night, and would wake up extra early in the morning, so they can watch their favorite cartoons. Adults prefer to hit the snooze button and sleep early to gather enough energy for the day. You were a child once too you know, although at times we forget... This difference in energy levels is our body's way of telling us it needs more energy.</p>



					<p>Sometimes the example is so simple, other times a little more serious. When we experience pain, it's the body's way of letting us know attention is needed as it begins to work to heal itself, something it is very good at. As a matter of fact, the only time the body cannot do its work is when we interrupt or stop it from doing so, or there is an imbalance in nutrition and enzyme production due to toxic buildup.</p>



					<p>ZoiVi's Premium Life Products are formulated to support the body and help bring it back in to balance, beginning with eliminating the buildup of toxins from the environment we live in. Once the body is balanced, it will do what it does best, and perform at optimum level. Achieving balance has never been so simple, or so easy!</p>
